// Heap: special tree-based data structure in which the tree -> complete binary tree.

/*
Heapify: a process of creating a heap from an array.
Insertion: process to insert an element in existing heap time complexity O(log N).
Deletion: deleting the top element of the heap or the highest priority element, and then organizing the heap and returning the element with time complexity O(log N).
Peek: to check or find the first (or can say the top) element of the heap.

Max-Heap: key present at the root node must be greatest among the keys present at all of it’s children. 
Min-Heap: In a Min-Heap the key present at the root node must be minimum among the keys present at all of it’s children.
